                            <h5 >Information You Provide to Us</h5>
                            <p>When you create a BRCK account, you provide us with Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, password, and payment information. </p>
                            <p> 
                                If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, such as Office365 or Google, some information from those 
                                accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions. That Third Party Account Information transmitted to our 
                                Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. Additionally, BRCK’s use and transfer to any other app of information received from  Google Accounts will adhere to 
                                <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" class="text-underline">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.
                            </p>
                            <p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features within the Services.</p>
                            <h5>Information We Collect As You Use Our Services</h5>
                            <p>When you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information that we then use to provide the Services.</p>
                            <p><strong><em>Device and Session Information</em></strong>: We collect information about your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device IDs, or other unique identifiers, cookie information, the type of browser and/or 
                                device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. We use this data to customize your experience with our Services, based on your usage patterns. We also use it to improve the 
                                Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make decisions about future development focus. You may be able to change 
                                the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong><em>Telephony Information</em></strong>: We maintain customer call records such as time, duration, the number of the called party. Like all telephony services, we may also maintain temporary copies of call audio for up to 48 hours for quality assurance.</p>
                          <h3  class="dark-text-100 ">How does BRCK use personal Information</h3>
                          <p>BRCK uses Personal Information to deliver the Services, and also to improve the Services and to communicate with you about the Services, including marketing communications.</p>

                          <p>The main ways that we use the Personal Information that you provide to us or that we collect when you use the Service are to:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Deliver the Services, including placing and receiving voice calls and determining your geographic location for efficient call routing,</li>
                            <li>Manage your account and billing, to enable secure login and single sign on, and allow third party integrations;</li>
                            <li>Prevent, detect, and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud and violations of our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a 
                            confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more applicable and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, you can always opt out by unsubscribing through the link at 
                            the bottom of our emails.</p>
                            <p>BRCK uses Personal Information to improve or validate its features, and may securely share it with contractors to do so on BRCK’s behalf.</p>

                            <h3 class="dark-text-100 ">What personal information does BRCK share with third parties and why?</h3>

                            <p>We do not license or sell your Personal Information to third parties, including advertisers, without your consent. As described below, when we share any information about you with third parties, we pseudonymize and aggregate any information about you before 
                                we share it unless more detail is necessary to the function of the Services. Although BRCK’s Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies we don’t own or control or people that we don’t manage, our Data Processing Agreements with European 
                                customers and/or users in the European Union define how these third parties can use and store your information, consistent with this Policy.
                            </p>

                            <h5 >Cookies Policy, Third Party Analytics, and Tracking</h5>
                            <p>BRCK and third party service providers of tracking technologies gather non-personal information about how users enter, navigate, and leave the website and Services, the frequency and length of visits to the Services or third party websites, application or 
                                device usage data, and your product or service preference indicated by the number of times and the length of time you view a product. BRCK gathers this data using cookies (both first party cookies, such as the Google Analytics cookie, and third-party cookies, 
                                such as the DoubleClick cookie), web beacons, tags, and other similar techniques that deliver small files to your computer and which allow these networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.
                            </p>

                            <h5 >BRCK uses certain third-party services that help us understand traffic on our website in various ways:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Google Analytics and Google Adwords help BRCK understand who is visiting BRCK’s websites and to show relevant ads on other websites to people who have visited BRCK’s websites. You can control what ads you see through the 
                                    <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated" target="_blank" class="text-underline">Google Ad Settings Manager</a>.  More information on how Google uses information collected when you use Google’s partner sites is available at 
                                    <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en-US" target="_blank" class="text-underline">Google’s Partner Technologies</a> page.
                                </li>
                                <li>Marketo is a marketing automation tool that handles various marketing tasks, such as contacting visitors who provide their contact information and requested additional information. You can read more about Marketo's Privacy Policy and opt-out 
                                    options here via <a href="https://documents.marketo.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" class="text-underline">Marketo’s Privacy Notice</a>.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>You may be able to opt out of tracking conducted by third parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser; but we don’t control whether or how these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests. Our Services 
                                do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.
                            </p>

                            <h5 >Agents, Subprocessors, and Contractors</h5>
                            <p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide the Services to you. For example, we use a payment processing service to receive and process your credit card transactions 
                                for us. Our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us and may not use such information for marketing purposes. We may authorize access to your data for those employees, 
                                contractors, partners, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop and improve products and services. When we transfer data of customers in the European Union to agents and third parties, we remain liable for ensuring that it is kept secure.
                            </p>
                            <h5 >Business Transfers</h5>
                            <p>If we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>

                            <h5>Protection of BRCK and Others</h5>
                            <p>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Personal Information that we believe is necessary to comply with the law; to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, a court order or subpoena; to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other 
                                agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of BRCK, our employees, our users, or others, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="dark-text-100">How is personal information about me secured?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Your account is protected by a password, and your Personal Information is encrypted in transit and in storage using industry standard encryption. If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via 
                                that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
                            </p>
                            <p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
                            <h3 class="dark-text-100">How can I access, manage, and delete my data?</h3>
                            <p>Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit, or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>name and password</li>
                                <li>email address</li>

                            <p>
                                The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. You also have the right to access, correct, amend, or delete information that we hold via support@brck.com. When you update information, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                ou may request deletion of your BRCK user account by contacting support@brck.com. After deletion of your account, some information may remain in our records for a period of time that is consistent with the purpose it was collected for. We may use any anonymized and aggregated data derived from your
                                 Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
                            </p>
                            <p>Following the cancellation of your Services, we will delete and/or anonymize information related to your account so that no personal information is retained by BRCK or its contractors, unless otherwise required by law.</p>

                            <h3 class="dark-text-100">How does BRCK comply with specific state and country laws?</h3>
                            <h5 >California and CCPA</h5>
                            <p>BRCK complies with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and related laws.</p>
                            <h5>COPPA Compliance Statement</h5>
                            <p>BRCK does not provide services designed for use by children under the age of 13, nor does it knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected such information we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13
                                 has provided us personal information, please contact us at support@brck.com.</p>

                            <h3 class="dark-text-100">What happens when BRCK makes changes to this privacy policy?</h3>
                            <p>
                                We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well. We will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the BRCK website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us
                                 (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.
                            </p>
