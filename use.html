                                BRCK may provide customer and technical support to you via telephone, chat, forums, FAQ and email for the Services. The types of support provided by BRCK is dependent on the products that you purchased and the number of seats using BRCK in your organization. The types of support provided

                            <p>BRCK will use reasonable efforts to facilitate number transfers or port requests for you, provided that You comply with the necessary and specific procedures for porting between service providers. You acknowledge and understand that number porting depends on the cooperation of third parties outside of BRCK’s 
                                control. Accordingly, you agree that BRCK will not be liable for the failure or delay of any third party to cooperate in the porting of any telephone number, or for the allegedly unauthorized porting of any telephone number by a third party.</p>
                            
                            <p>BRCK works with third party carrier(s) who, on BRCK’s behalf, port telephone numbers in accordance with applicable regulatory rules and industry guidelines. BRCK’s third-party carrier(s) require very specific and detailed information and requirements when completing a port request. Please be informed that you 
                                will be required to provide such detailed and specific information to complete a port request. For porting numbers into your BRCK account, follow the procedures on your account settings page for transferring a number to your BRCK account. For porting numbers out of your BRCK account, follow the procedures of 
                                your new service provider. You understand that porting your number out of your Account does not automatically terminate your BRCK account.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                BRCK cannot guarantee requested telephone numbers will be available, that your existing provider will port your number, or that circumstances beyond BRCK’s control will not prevent or delay a successful port of your number for the Services. You should not order any printed material, such as business cards or 
                                stationery, showing a telephone number, or issue any press releases or otherwise publicize any telephone number until that telephone number becomes active on your Account. BRCK shall not be liable for reimbursement for press releases, business cards, and/or stationery under any conditions.

                                We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well. We will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the BRCK website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us
                                 (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.

BRCK shall not be liable for any damages (including consequential, special damages or other damages) to you in the event that it needs to assign you a new telephone number.

                            <p>WE RECOMMEND YOU MAKE ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO PLACE 911 CALLS, SUCH AS USING A TRADITIONAL WIRELINE OR CELLULAR TELEPHONE, AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON BRCK TO CALL 911.</p>
                            <p>BRCK DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATING TO YOUR (OR ANY OF YOUR USERS OR THIRD PARTIES) INABILITY TO MAKE 911 CALLS OR ACCESS EMERGENCY SERVICES.</p>
                            <p>
                                BRCK VoIP 911 Service (“BRCK 911 Service”) operates differently than traditional 911 service. We are required by the FCC to advise you of the circumstances under which 911 may not be available or may be in some way limited by comparison to traditional 911 service. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, Internet Connection Failure, 
                                Number Flexibility & Porting, and Loss of Electrical Power (as described below):
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Internet connection failure. If the connection to the wired broadband internet over which your BRCK Service is provided is interrupted, you would not have access to BRCK Service during that interruption and therefore will not have access to BRCK 911 Service during that interruption.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Number Flexibility & Service Portability. Traditional 911 service automatically sends your 911 call to the appropriate local emergency responder, or Public Safety Answering Point (“PSAP”), based on your telephone number. Traditional Enhanced 911 service (also known as E911) automatically sends your 911 call to the appropriate PSAP along with your 
                                registered address and telephone number. Because the BRCK Service permits you to obtain a telephone number that does not correspond to your geographic location (for example, you may obtain a BRCK telephone number with a California area code even if you do not have a California address) and allows you to use BRCK Service anywhere you have wired 
                                broadband Internet, the BRCK 911 Service functions differently than traditional 911 service in certain respects: Because your address does not necessarily correspond with your telephone number, you must provide BRCK with the street address(es) where you will be using BRCK Service (“Registered Location(s)”) when you sign up for BRCK service. 
                                If you relocate any equipment (e.g., PC with softphone, IP phone, or ATA with traditional phone) that you use to access the BRCK Service, you must update your Registered Location(s). If you do not update your Registered Location(s), any 911 calls you make using the BRCK Service will be routed based on your previously provided Registered 
                                Location and therefore may not be routed to the appropriate PSAP for your new location. In addition, because the BRCK Service will, where possible, automatically transmit your Registered Location to the PSAP, you must update your Registered Location to ensure that the BRCK Service transmits accurate location information to the PSAP. 
                                Once you notify us of a change in your Registered Location, there may be a delay in making the new Registered Location available to properly route 911 calls and advise PSAPs of your new Registered Location. In some parts of the country where direct routing to PSAPs is not available for BRCK 911 Service, the Service will route your 
                                call to the National Emergency Call Center where trained agents will ask for the name, location, and telephone number of the person calling 911 and will contact the appropriate PSAP to send help. The call center will not automatically receive your address and telephone number. In these situations, public safety response times may be 
                                delayed. As a result, there may be an additional delay before emergency services arrive.

                                Loss of Electrical Power. Unless you have a backup system to power your wired broadband Internet connection and any equipment (PC with softphone, IP phone, ATA with traditional phone) that You use to access your BRCK Service, you will not have phone service or 911 service during any power outage.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Registration of Physical Locations Required. As discussed above, you must register the Registered Location where you will be using BRCK Service for each phone number you use from BRCK (e.g., if you purchase BRCK with three numbers, you must provide a Registered Location for each of the three numbers). BRCK will obtain your Registered 
                                Location as part of the service initiation process and will not provide BRCK Service until you have provided your initial Registered Location. However, you must update your Registered Location when you use your BRCK Service from a new location. Regardless of what address you register, in some circumstances, such as unavailability of 
                                direct routing to PSAPs or the use of portable devices to access the BRCK Service, emergency calls will be routed to the National Emergency Call Center.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete Registered Location information to BRCK as part of the service initiation process and to update as soon as possible your Registered Location with true, accurate, current, and complete information whenever you use your BRCK Service from a new location. If you provide Registered 
                                Location information that is, or that BRCK suspects to be, false, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, BRCK has the right to suspend or terminate the Services and refuse any and all current or future use of all Services, or any portion thereof. BRCK will not, however, disable your ability to make a 911 call during any service suspension.
                            </p>
                            <p>You may update your Registered Location by logging on to your account settings page or contacting BRCK customer support at support@brck.com. For purposes of 911 dialing, you may only register one Registered Location for each BRCK phone number.</p>
                            <p>
                                Notify All Users of 911 Limitations. You must inform all business colleagues, household residents, guests, and other persons who may be present at the physical location where you utilize the BRCK Service that 911 may not be available or may be in some way limited in comparison to traditional 911 service.
                            </p>

BRCK disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of PSAPs, the National Emergency Call Center, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency response services.

                                for whether they answer 911 calls made using the BRCK Service, how they answer these calls, or how they handle or respond to these calls. BRCK relies on third parties to assist it in the provision of 911 service and disclaims any and all liability for acts or omissions by third parties in the provision of BRCK’s 911 service.
