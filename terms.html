                                When you subscribe to Services, you will provide us with a valid payment method, such as a valid credit card (including proper billing information), and, if applicable, authorize us to collect from your payment method. Any authorization will remain valid until thirty (30) days after you terminate our authority to charge 
                                your payment method. Upon termination, we will charge you any fees and any other outstanding charges and disconnect your Service. You agree to advise and notify us of any changes to your payment method, such as credit card account number or expiration date changes. If the credit card or other payment method on your Account 
                                is declined or fails for any reason, BRCK will use reasonable efforts to contact you and advise you of the failed billing attempts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BRCK reserves the right to disconnect your Service and terminate your Account if your credit card on file is declined or fails for any reason, and BRCK reserves 
                                the right to continue to attempt charging your credit card for any outstanding Service charges and additional fees and pursue any other legal remedies available to BRCK.

Therefore, you agree to pay us interest at the lesser rate of (a) 18% per annum or (b) the highest rate allowed by law for any amounts unpaid as of the due date. Acceptance of late or partial payments (even if marked “Paid in Full”) shall not waive any of BRCK’s rights to collect the 
                                full amount due. We may assess an additional fee of the lesser of (a) fifty dollars ($50) or (b) the highest amount allowed by law for any credit card chargeback or check returned for nonpayment.

                            <p>You must dispute any charges for the Services in writing to BRCK within thirty (30) days of the date of the charge by BRCK.

Any Campaign also must permit any applicable End User(s) to revoke any prior consent at any time and in any manner consistent with customary industry standards, including, without limitation, the text of the word “Stop.” Customer will ensure that End User(s) are informed of (and have readily available access to) a process to cancel receipt of SMS message(s) 
                                                    from any applicable Campaign and/or “opting out” of any such SMS message(s). Customer will immediately stop sending SMS message(s) to any End User who has “opted out” of any applicable Campaign.

                                                    acts or omissions that otherwise would violate these Product Terms. Customer also will comply with any other existing or future regulatory obligations and/or customary industry standards that apply to any Campaign from time to time.</li>

                                    Service Limitations. Messaging and A2P Messaging do not provide any audio and/or voice capabilities and/or other features. In addition to any other rights or remedies that BRCK may have under any applicable circumstances, BRCK, in its sole and unfettered discretion, may block any Messaging and A2P Messaging traffic BRCK deems to be in violation of the Services Agreement, these Product Terms, the AUP, and/or any agreements, 
                                    arrangements and/or practices of or between BRCK and any carriers and/or other service providers. Any violation of any of the foregoing provisions of this Section 3 could cause Customer’s TN, TFN, Short Code and/or any applicable TN, TFN, or Short Code to be blocked for outbound message transmission by BRCK and/or traffic blocking and/or black-listing by any applicable receiving carriers and/or other service providers; 
                                    BRCK does not guarantee removal from any applicable black-listed status. BRCK may block at any time any messages deemed by BRCK in its sole and unfettered discretion to jeopardize the integrity of BRCK’s network (including, without limitation, due to any action taken and/or threatened by any third party carrier and/or other service provider) and any such blockage will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy that 
                                    BRCK may have due to any such messages pursuant to the Services Agreement, these Product Terms, the AUP or otherwise. If any such blocking of any messages occurs, BRCK may, in its discretion, attempt to block only the TNs, TFNs, and/or Short Codes breaching these Product Terms and/or jeopardizing BRCK’s network. If the blocking of individual TNs, TFNs, or Short Codes is not feasible for any reason, as determined by BRCK 
                                    in its sole and unfettered discretion, BRCK reserves the right to block all message(s) initiated by Customer and/or any applicable End Users of Customer. If BRCK blocks any messages pursuant to this Section 3, BRCK will make commercially reasonable attempts to notify Customer in advance of such blockage, provided, however, BRCK will be under no obligation to provide any such notification, including, without limitation, 
                                    if circumstances do not permit delay of any blockage or other action by BRCK for any reason. Customer acknowledges and agrees that messages to or from Customer or Customer’s End Users may be blocked by carriers or other service providers for reasons known or unknown to BRCK; BRCK is under no obligation to investigate or remedy any such blockage for Customer or any of Customer’s End Users. BRCK does not guarantee delivery, 
                                    regardless of the reason, of any messages.

                                    Connection. Customer must connect to BRCK’s network in a manner and, if applicable, at locations determined by BRCK. Customer will, at Customer’s sole cost, be responsible for providing all equipment (including proxy servers), software, facilities and IP connectivity (including, without limitation, connectivity to Customer’s End Users) necessary for Customer’s Messaging and/or A2P Messaging applications and Customer’s network to operate with Messaging and/or 
                                    A2P Messaging, and for providing and ensuring the successful installation of all equipment and software necessary for Customer’s End Users to use services sold to such End Users. Customer will have the sole responsibility to input, validate and maintain accurate information with respect to Customer’s End Users; Customer will furthermore be solely responsible for all support of and for Customer’s End Users as it relates to Messaging and/or A2P Messaging.

                                    Interoperability. If applicable, Customer and BRCK will reasonably cooperate with each other to test to ensure interoperability between BRCK and Customer’s networks and systems. All necessary interoperability testing will be completed within a reasonable time. If after completion of initial interoperability, Customer plan to make upgrades, updates and/or enhancements (collectively “Configuration Changes”), Customer will notify BRCK prior to implementing a 
                                    Configuration Change so that Customer and BRCK may work together in good faith to determine how best to proceed regarding such Configuration Change. If at any time an interoperability condition occurs that adversely affects BRCK’s network that cannot be adequately remedied within a reasonable period, taking into consideration the severity of the interoperability condition and the effect on BRCK’s network, BRCK may, at its sole discretion, suspend the 
                                    provision of Services pursuant to these Product Terms. The Parties will communicate as reasonably necessary to isolate and repair any problems in their respective networks, provided, however, each Party will remain solely responsible for any costs or liabilities incurred in connection with the repair of any problem with respect to such Party’s network.

                                            Message Rating. Messaging and/or A2P Messaging rates messages for billing purposes on a per message segment sent and/or received basis. Billable components of each message are based on: (i) the authorized IP sending a message (“Outbound Message”), and (ii) Customer of a TN, TFN or Short Code receiving a message (“Inbound Message”). Long message content will be split into multiple billable segments based on received data encoding. If any fee(s) 
                                            is imposed by any destination network, including, without limitation, any international termination fee(s), BRCK will charge Customer such fee(s) and reserves the right to include an administrative or other fee(s) in addition to any such fee(s). For clarity, this paragraph applies to both Messaging and A2P Messaging Services.

                                            Carrier and/or Third Party Fees and Charges. If there are termination fees, additional out-of-pocket fee(s), or other charges levied by a carrier or any third party for the traffic processed by BRCK on behalf of Customer, including, without limitation, carrier fee(s) and/or code administrator fee(s), BRCK will invoice Customer for those fees and any fees required to support the transaction. BRCK will, to the extent reasonably practicable, notify 
                                            Customer in writing (including email notification) in advance of any charge or fee assessed by a carrier and/or third party in connection with Customer’s receipt of the Services set forth herein. If it is not reasonably practicable for BRCK to provide notice to Customer of any such fees, BRCK will provide such notice promptly upon the date BRCK is notified that such fees have commenced.

                                    Porting Numbers. BRCK may require a completed and signed Letter of Authorization (“LOA”) for any telephone numbers that Customer wishes to port from another carrier to BRCK. BRCK may require a recent copy of the current phone bill that contains Customer’s Billing Telephone Number (“BTN”) as well as a record of any TNs and/or TFNs that need to be ported, a Customer Service Record (“CSR”), and/or an Equipment Record (“ER”). BRCK must receive the necessary 
                                    LOA(s) and/or bill copy(ies) before BRCK will initiate a port request and obtain a Confirmed Port Date. The “Confirmed Port Date” is the date upon which the current voice provider has agreed to port a TNs and/or TFNs to BRCK. The Confirmed Port Date interval may in some cases take as long as one (1) to two (2) business weeks after Customer initiates the port request. Since the port interval is a product of the accuracy of the information provided to BRCK 
                                    by Customer, as well as the processing speed of Customer’s current voice provider, BRCK makes no guarantees regarding the promptness of a port, however all ports will be provided consistent with applicable law.

                                    Number Management. Customer will obtain numbering resources from BRCK in amounts only reasonably necessary for Customer to conduct its business and as contemplated by the Services Agreement. BRCK retains the right to reclaim non-utilized numbering resources that Customer does not activate for use in its Account, to allow for usage within fourteen (14) days of ordering.

Customer acknowledges and agrees that MMS interoperability 
                                            is an evolving standard. Messages are exchanged between service providers on a best efforts basis and BRCK does not guarantee delivery. Customer will pay BRCK with respect to MMS pursuant to the rates set forth in the Service Order Form. For clarity, such rates will apply to each intended recipient and/or each text message. All terms and conditions applicable to Messaging and A2P Messaging pursuant to the Services Agreement, these Product Terms or 
                                            otherwise also will apply to MMS. For clarity, Customer will be solely responsible for compliance by Customer (and by Customer’s End Users) with any CTIA Messaging Principles applicable to any utilization of MMS by Customer, Customer’s End Users, or any other person or entity to which Customer provides any services utilizing MMS.

                                            The following applies only if Customer utilizes 2 Factor Authentication in connection with any Messaging Service: 2 Factor Authentication (“2FA”), also known as Multi-Factor Authentication (“MFA”), is a service that provides Customers with the ability to request a unique, time-limited code be sent to an End User on a pre-established communication channel for the purpose of validating, verifying or authorizing such End User. 2FA is commonly used 
                                            as a method of authentication for End User service log-ins, but may be used in a variety of other use cases that may require validation, verification or authentication information delivery.
